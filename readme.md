I don't know how to export the import table of PE file with [PE-bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases)

I want the function list, but there is no option for me to do it


so I write this little tool, it is enough for me

usage:
```
pe-parser.exe C:\users\x\downloads\srv2.sys
```

for some reason (maybe my shit code), you have to run it in visual studio

result will be saved in .\motherfuckerout.txt
